DB
(DONE)- add the DB to the app
- create a model for a game: id, attempts, game status (boolean)

API
- config file file:
  - range
  - max attempts
- post for a new game
  - generate a random number from 1 - 5
- get for an existing game
- patch for an update (attempts + done)
  - if the attempts exceed


Client
(DONE)- create a base UI
- create a component with a form with a number input
  - on init create a new game
    - maybe add the link to the URL so that the user can reload the page and keep playing an unfinished game
- add success component (or use it in the form component)
- add a failure component (or user it in the form component)

Tests
- write unit tests for the API
- write e2e tests
- write unit tests for UI components

Style (optional)
- add some custom style

Other
- update the readme with other instructions and description of the app
- create a github repo (or bitbucket)
- create a zip file with the app
- add a DB dump to the zip file
- create a heroku app (if there's time)

Spec:
Exercise description:
·         Create an interface that allows a user to enter a number in a certain range.
·         There has to be a predefined number hidden from the user (generated on back-end side).
·         The user should know what that range is and should be able to have three attempts.
·         Every time the user enters a number, this will be logged in a database and show in the interface the number of intents. (using file-system is also fine)
·         If the user enters a number that matches the predefined number, a success message should be shown.

Note:
- Use node.js and any front-end framework
- preferable don't use any extensive seed or boilerplate
- make sure your code is tested
- pay attention to the code quality

Deliverable
·         All application files plus the database dump (if applicable) in a zip file.
·         Please Upload the zip file in a cloud such as Google Drive or Dropbox and send the link.
